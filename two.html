            <p>
              Jane, I've made it plain<br>
              Although I'm faded as a ghost<br>
              I want you here inside me<br>
              Say the word<br>
              Oh, you've been playing nice<br>
              But I can see it in your eyes<br>
              You're thinking, "Christ<br>
              He's everybody's girl."<br>
              <br>
              You can't spend the night<br>
              <br>
              Jane, I've seen you at the club<br>
              You were tearin' up the rug<br>
              With no regard for form<br>
              You're such a brute!<br>
              You had a ready elbow<br>
              For the girls you hate<br>
              Or just don't know<br>
              You head-butt me<br>
              Cause you thought it was cute<br>
              <br>
              You can't spend the night<br>
              Yes, I'm sure you're right<br>
              You can't spend the night<br>
              Yeah, I'm sure you're right<br>
              You can't spend the night<br>
              Yes, I'm sure you're right<br>
              But we could spend the night together<br>
              Or alone. That would be better<br>
              <br>
              It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody<br>
              Oh, what's the use of making the bed?<br>
              I took something and it feels like karate<br>
              It's kicked me down and left me for dead<br>
              It's Friday night and I ain't got nobody<br>
              So what's the use of pulling a shape?<br>
              I put what I want, when I want, in my body<br>
              I'm never gonna give what I take<br>
              <br>
              Jane, I've seen the pain you've dealt<br>
              You've been with all my friends<br>
              You tell me guard my heart<br>
              I might get hurt<br>
              No doubt you'll hurt my feelings<br>
              And it's a given I'll be kneeling<br>
              But I'm telling myself<br>
              That it's gonna be worth it<br>
              <br>
              You can't spend the night<br>
              Yes, I'm sure you're right<br>
              You can't spend the night<br>
              Yeah, I'm sure you're right<br>
              You can't spend the night<br>
              Yes, I'm sure you're right<br>
              But we could spend the night together<br>
              Or alone. That would be better<br>

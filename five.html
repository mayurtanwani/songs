            <h2>LYRICS</h2>
            <p>You used to get it in your fishnets<br>
                Now you only get it in your night dress<br>
                Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness<br>
                Landed in a very common crisis<br>
                <br>
                Everything's in order in a black hole<br>
                Nothing seems as pretty as the past though<br>
                That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco<br>
                Remember when you used to be a rascal?<br>
                <br>
                Oh the boy's a slag<br>
                The best you ever had<br>
                The best you ever had is just a memory<br>
                And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem<br>
                Not as daft as they seem,<br>
                My love, when you dream them up...<br>
                <br>
                Flicking through a little book of sex tips<br>
                Remember when the boys were all electric?<br>
                Now when she's told she's gonna get it<br>
                I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it<br>
                <br>
                Clinging to not getting sentimental<br>
                Said she wasn't going but she went still<br>
                Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle<br>
                Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?<br>
                <br>
                Oh the boy's a slag<br>
                The best you ever had<br>
                The best you ever had is just a memory<br>
                And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem<br>
                Not as daft as they seem,<br>
                My love, when you dream them up<br>
                <br>
                Oh, Flo, where did you go?<br>
                Where did you go?<br>
                Where did you go? Whoa.<br>
                <br>
                Falling about<br>
                You took a left off Last Laugh Lane<br>
                Just sounding it out<br>
                But you're not coming back again.<br>
                <br>
                you're falling about<br>
                You took a left off Last Laugh Lane<br>
                We're just sounding it out<br>
                But you're not coming back again<br>
                <br>
                You used to get it in your fishnets<br>
                (falling about)<br>
                Now you only get it in your night dress<br>
                Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness<br>
                (you took a left off Last Laugh Lane)<br>
                Landed in a very common crisis<br>
                <br>

            <p>
                Now here you go again<br>
                You say you want your freedom<br>
                Well, who am I to keep you down?<br>
                It's only right that you should<br>
                Play the way you feel it<br>
                But listen carefully to the sound<br>
                Of your loneliness<br>
                <br>
                Like a heartbeat... drives you mad<br>
                In the stillness of remembering what you had<br>
                And what you lost...<br>
                And what you had...<br>
                And what you lost<br>
                <br>
                Thunder only happens when it's raining<br>
                Players only love you when they're playing<br>
                Say... Women... they will come and they will go<br>
                When the rain washes you clean... you'll know, you'll know<br>
                <br>
                Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions<br>
                I keep my visions to myself<br>
                It's only me<br>
                Who wants to wrap around your dreams and...<br>
                Have you any dreams you'd like to sell?<br>
                Dreams of loneliness...<br>
                <br>
                Like a heartbeat... drives you mad...<br>
                In the stillness of remembering what you had...<br>
                And what you lost...<br>
                And what you had...<br>
                And what you lost<br>
                <br>
                Thunder only happens when it's raining<br>
                Players only love you when they're playing<br>
                Women they will come and they will go<br>
                When the rain washes you clean, you'll know<br>
                <br>
                Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining<br>
                Players only love you when they're playing<br>
                Say women they will come and they will go<br>
                When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know<br>
                You will know, you'll know
